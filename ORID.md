O: Today, I learned about user journey mapping, product vision development, and prompt engineering. We explored how to create effective user journeys to understand user interactions with a product, establish a clear product vision to guide development, and apply prompt engineering techniques to enhance user experience and engagement.

R: The hands-on exercises were particularly engaging; mapping user journeys helped me visualize the user experience from start to finish, while developing a product vision clarified our goals and direction. I felt inspired by the potential of well-crafted prompts to improve user interactions and streamline communication within applications.

I: Understanding user journeys and product vision is crucial for creating user-centered products. These concepts foster empathy and ensure that development aligns with user needs. Prompt engineering complements this by optimizing how users engage with the product, making interactions more intuitive and effective.

D: Moving forward, I plan to incorporate user journey mapping and product vision development in my future projects to ensure a user-centered approach. Additionally, I will experiment with prompt engineering techniques to enhance user interactions and share insights with my team to promote collaborative learning and innovation.
