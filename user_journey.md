Current Business Processes in the Existing System
Overview of the Existing System
The current movie ticket reservation system primarily operates through a web and mobile application that allows users to search for movies, view showtimes, and purchase tickets. While the system aims to provide a user-friendly experience, it has several operational issues and pain points that detract from user satisfaction, particularly for tech-savvy individuals like Jake Reynolds.

Key Business Processes
User Registration and Account Management:
Users create accounts to manage bookings and preferences.
The process requires inputting personal details, which can be cumbersome, especially if users need to re-enter information frequently.
Movie Discovery:
Users browse available movies via a search function or categorized lists (e.g., by genre or popularity).
The interface often lacks visual appeal and intuitive design, leading to difficulties in quickly identifying desired content.
Showtime Selection:
Users select a movie and then choose from available showtimes.
The current layout may not clearly display all options, causing confusion and frustration.
Seat Selection:
Users must manually choose seats from a static seating chart, which may not offer a clear visual representation of availability.
Group bookings are complicated, requiring multiple selections and often leading to errors or miscommunication among users.
Payment Processing:
Users proceed to a payment screen, where they enter payment details.
The payment interface can be cluttered, and users often encounter hidden fees that add to frustration.
Booking Confirmation:
After payment, users receive a booking confirmation via email or app notification.
The lack of real-time updates on booking status can lead to uncertainty, especially for group bookings.
Social Sharing Features:
Users can share their movie plans on social media, but the current integration is limited and not user-friendly.
Features for coordinating group outings are underdeveloped, making it difficult for users like Jake to organize plans with friends.
Issues and Pain Points
Complex Navigation: The system's interface can be cluttered, making it challenging for users to find movies and showtimes quickly.
Repetitive Data Entry: Users are required to re-enter personal information and preferences each time they book, which is inefficient and frustrating.
Inadequate Group Booking Features: The current process lacks intuitive tools for coordinating multiple tickets for group outings, leading to confusion.
Poor Visual Design: The aesthetic quality of the app does not meet the expectations of users who value design, resulting in a negative overall experience.
Hidden Fees: Unexpected fees during the payment process create distrust and dissatisfaction among users.
Limited Social Features: The app does not effectively support social interactions, which are important for users who wish to share their experiences and plans with friends.
Conclusion
The existing movie ticket reservation system has several operational processes that aim to provide a seamless booking experience. However, significant pain points and issues hinder user satisfaction, particularly for tech-savvy and design-oriented individuals like Jake.
